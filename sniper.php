        <p>A simple Battleship-like puzzle game, written for Fooad Khosmood's experimental <i>Interactive Entertainment Engineering</i> course at Cal Poly.  As the class' first project, the goal of this exercise was to familiarize students with incorporating narrative in games.</p>
<p>You are a lone sniper, pinned in a building by another rival gunner.  Using only the materials you find, you must pinpoint your opponent's position while avoiding his crosshairs.</p>
<p>Created in one day in a frenzied attempt to meet the deadline.  Surprisingly, it ranked among the top IFs in peer review.</p>
