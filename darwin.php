        <p>Written for <a href="http://users.csc.calpoly.edu/~fkurfess/">Franz Kurfess'</a> Artificial Intelligence course, Darwin is Dead is a simple top-down arena shooter that uses a genetic algorithm to generate enemies.  Each "zombie" would possess a certain number of "traits" taken from a larger pool.  Each trait would represent a different ability: weapon types, movement speeds, etc.  Zombies with the greatest survivability would sexually pass their traits onto the following wave, while randomly adding untapped traits from the pool.  The algorithm would "converge" when the player is defeated.</p>

        <p>The graphics are rather programmer, I know.</p>
		<p>I was the de facto project lead for the game, designing the architecture such that other members could easily extend a few classes to create their own traits and weapons.  This kept everyone's work mostly independent, which was helpful considering the little time we had to spare for meetings.</p>
		<p>This led to someâ€¦interesting variations in gameplay, for better or worse.</p>
